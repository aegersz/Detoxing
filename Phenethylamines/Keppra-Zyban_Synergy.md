## ⚙️ Mechanism-Level Synergy

| System         | Keppra (Levetiracetam)                        | Zyban (Bupropion)                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **CNS Focus**  | Synaptic vesicle modulation (SV2A)            | Dopamine & Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor |
| **Tone**       | Smooths over-excitation                       | Rebuilds motivational drive                  |
| **Seizure Risk** | Decreases dramatically                      | Can raise it slightly — balance needed       |
| **Cognitive Impact** | Clears noise without sedation          | Mildly stimulating without euphoria          |

Together, they produce a **clear, non-manic stimulation** that **dampens electrical chaos** while **amplifying productive circuits**.
