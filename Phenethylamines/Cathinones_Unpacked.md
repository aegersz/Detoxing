## 🧪 What Are Cathinones?

Cathinones are **beta-keto amphetamines** — think of them as **amphetamine with an oxygen tattoo** on the beta carbon. Structurally and pharmacologically, they form a wide spectrum:

- ⚠️ **Potent stimulants**: e.g. Mephedrone, MDPV, α-PVP (aka “flakka”), Methcathinone  
- ✅ **Therapeutic outliers**: e.g. **Bupropion**, the black sheep turned doctor-approved  
- ⚗️ **Natural prototype**: Cathinone itself — found in *khat* leaves

## ⚖️ Core Structure (Simplified)

**Cathinone = Phenethylamine base + Beta-keto group**

```text
Phenethylamine core:
    |
    NH2—CH—CH2—[Ar]
           |
        Ketone (C=O) → Cathinone!
