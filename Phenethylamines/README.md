# MA_Detox_Strategies

**Author**: Andrew Egerszegi  
**Tagline**: *“Detox isn’t defeat. It’s the declaration of system mastery.”*  

This folder contains my personal strategies and supporting pharmacology for transitioning off Methamphetamine (MA) with intelligence, precision, and full neurochemical awareness.

## 📘 Glossary of Key Terms

- **MA**: Methamphetamine. High-dopamine stimulant with brutal withdrawal symptoms when used long-term.  
- **Bupropion**: A non-addictive DNRI used for depression and smoking cessation — repurposed here as a smart dopaminergic substitute.  
- **DNRI**: Dopamine-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor. Boosts alertness, motivation, and focus without serotonin drag.  
- **Phenethylamine (PEA)**: The molecular root of dopamine, amphetamine, and all major stimulants — the archetype backbone.  
- **Cathinones**: Beta-keto cousins of amphetamines. Can be dangerous (MDPV) or therapeutic (Bupropion).  
- **Keppra (Levetiracetam)**: A clean anti-seizure medication used to eliminate convulsive risk during stimulant transitions.  
- **DLPA**: D,L-Phenylalanine — a dual-acting precursor that enhances endorphin and dopamine levels naturally.  
- **BBB**: Blood-Brain Barrier — a checkpoint for molecules entering the brain. Bupropion passes, but gently.  
- **PAWS**: Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome — the shadowy phase after stimulant withdrawal where relapse is high.

## 🧠 Philosophy of Detox

I approach detox not as abstinence, but as an a attempt at sobriety (or tolerance reduction) and as a **transformation**. Every molecule in this repo serves a **purpose**, every strategy is tuned for **dopaminergic integrity**, and all documents are part of a **cognitive rearchitecture**.
