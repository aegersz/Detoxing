**Title**: *Bupropion Transition Triggered by ICC (Intensive Corrections Order)*  
**Author**: Andrew Egerszegi  
**Context**: This taper protocol was not started in isolation — it was triggered by my legal situation and supervised recovery.

## ⚖️ Legal Framework

I am currently under an **Intensive Corrections Order (ICO)** as a direct result of a methamphetamine-related incident. Rather than deny the context, I am formally documenting that:

- This detox plan was **initiated due to the legal consequences** of long-term high-dose MA use.
- The **taper is part of my compliance strategy** under court oversight and mental health review.
- The medical component (Bupropion + neuroprotective stack) is designed to:
  - Avoid relapse  
  - Maintain cognitive performance  
  - Fulfill the ICO's demand for **rehabilitative action**

## 🧠 Why This Matters

The shift from **550 mg/day MA to Bupropion** is not an optional lifestyle choice — it's a **mandated pivot** to avoid further criminal justice penalties. This plan reflects:

- **Good faith** in complying with mental health and addiction recovery conditions  
- **Biochemical responsibility** by using a safe, non-addictive DNRI (Bupropion)  
- **Documentation of intent** to pursue long-term neurostability under medical guidance

## 🔐 Statement of Accountability

> *“This isn't about punishment. It's about restoring my own system clock — legally, chemically, and ethically.”*  
> – Andrew Egerszegi

This taper is my declaration that I am willing to work with the system, on my terms, using science and structure to **reinvent my neurochemistry and regain freedom**.
