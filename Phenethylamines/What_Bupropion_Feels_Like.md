## 🧘 What It Doesn’t Do

- ❌ Doesn’t make you high  
- ❌ Doesn’t sedate  
- ❌ Doesn’t flatten your emotions like SSRIs  
- ✅ Keeps you functional, not manic

## ⚠️ Common Side Effects (Temporary)

- Insomnia (dose AM only)  
- Mild anxiety in first 3–5 days  
- Dry mouth  
- Headache (usually transient)

## ⏳ Timeline of Onset

- **Day 1–3**: Little noticeable effect  
- **Day 4–7**: Lifting of fog, calmer wake-up  
- **Week 2+**: Motivation creeps back into routines  
- **By Week 3**: Often taken for granted — a good sign
