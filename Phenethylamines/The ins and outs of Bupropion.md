## 💊 What Is Bupropion?

Bupropion is a **Dopamine-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (DNRI)**.  
It's used for:
- Depression (especially low-energy subtypes)
- Nicotine addiction (as Zyban)
- Stimulant withdrawal support (off-label)
- Attention and motivation without serotonin fog

> *“Think of it as a dopamine stabilizer with a soft touch.”*

## 🧠 Mechanism of Action

- Inhibits dopamine (DAT) and norepinephrine (NET) reuptake
- Minimal action on serotonin (SERT) — no SSRI-type side effects
- Also a weak **nicotinic antagonist** — helps reduce smoking urges
- Metabolized into **Hydroxybupropion** — the active metabolite
- Chemically a **beta-keto phenethylamine** (aka a cathinone)

## ⚖️ Pros vs Cons

| Pros                                  | Cons                                       |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Boosts energy and motivation          | Can increase anxiety or insomnia           |
| Low abuse potential                   | Seizure risk if misused or overstacked     |
| No serotonin-related side effects     | May feel emotionally flat for some users   |
| Excellent for MA/nicotine taper       | Takes days to reach full effect            |

## 💡 Ideal For

- MA or stimulant tapering  
- Low dopamine tone depression  
- Fatigue-related mood flattening  
- Individuals avoiding SSRIs  

### ⚠️ Avoid If

- Seizure history  
- Eating disorders  
- Recent benzo or alcohol withdrawal  
- High-dose stimulant use without taper buffer  

---

## 💊 Dosing Guidance

- **Start**: 150 mg SR in the morning  
- **Target**: 300 mg SR (150 AM + 150 PM)  
- Avoid evening dosing due to insomnia risk  
- Always dose with food and hydration  
- Combine with:  
  - NAC  
  - DLPA or Tyrosine  
  - Magnesium + B6

## 🔄 Stimulant Taper Support

Bupropion is especially useful when reducing or quitting:
- Methamphetamine (MA)
- Cathinones (e.g., mephedrone, MDPV)
- Cocaine
- Nicotine
- Caffeine (less impactful, but helpful)

It provides:
- ✅ Dopamine continuity  
- 🎯 Focus and energy  
- 🧘 Craving suppression

---

## ⚙️ Suggested Stack

- **NAC**: 1200 mg/day – glutamate modulation  
- **Magnesium + B6**: nightly – nervous system buffer  
- **DLPA or Tyrosine**: morning – natural dopamine support  
- **Keppra (optional)**: 250–500 mg BID – seizure prevention if needed

> *“With the right buffer, Bupropion becomes the cleanest handoff in the game.”*

---

## 🧂 Final Notes

- Do not mix with SSRIs or MAOIs  
- Avoid redosing — it’s not that type of drug  
- Hydration, high-protein intake, and sleep = essential  
- Works best as part of a structured taper plan

> *“If you're using it right, you won’t feel it working — just your life moving again.”*
