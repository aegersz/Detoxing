**Why ?**: *Because I have no legal (or otherwise) access to Bupropion/Zyban*

**Title**: *Interim Stack for Methamphetamine Taper (Pre-Bupropion Phase)*  
**Author**: Andrew Egerszegi  
**Use Case**: Supporting neurochemical stability and resilience while tapering off Methamphetamine slowly, prior to initiating Bupropion.

## 🧠 Core Goals

- Reduce withdrawal symptoms  
- Support dopamine & glutamate balance  
- Minimize anxiety, agitation, and crash  
- Prepare brain for clean Bupropion onboarding

| **Metoprolol**   | 25–50 mg         | As needed      | Controls HR spikes, anxiety               |
| **B-Complex**    | Once daily       | With food      | Cofactors for neurotransmitter synthesis  |

## 🥤 Lifestyle Tips

- Hydrate heavily (urine should stay pale)
- Avoid sugar crashes  
- Maintain 7–8 hrs of sleep (Ashwagandha helps)  
- Get morning sunlight (reset dopamine clock)  
- Don’t stack unknowns — stay consistent  

---

## 🗓️ Optional Enhancements

- **ALCAR** (250–500 mg AM): Mitochondrial + dopamine transport  
- **Zinc + Selenium**: Trace minerals for neurotransmitter balance  
- **L-Theanine**: Smooths edge if DLPA/tyrosine too strong

---

## ✅ What to Avoid

- Sudden MA cuts without buffer  
- Mixing with SSRIs or alcohol  
- Overstimulating nootropics or racetams  
- Frequent redosing / rollercoastering
