## 🎶 My Constant: House Music

Even through the heaviest phases of tapering and legal pressure,  
**house music remains my escape, my therapy, my rhythm**.

While my neurochemistry shifts and routines change,  
the beat stays consistent —  
groovy, soulful, deep, and alive.

> *“Music reminds me who I am without the meth.  
It’s not a distraction — it’s an anchor.”*  
> – Andrew Egerszegi

Whether it’s Soulful House, Tech, Progressive, Chill, Deep Tech Minimal, or a forgotten SoundCloud gem —  
this soundtrack carries me from **chaos to clarity**.

*(too many to list but "Keep on Jumpin'" resonates)
